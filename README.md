This is a coed side project, not part of any CA related task given by Noroff. We are Noroff students who decided to work on our free time and create a webpage using pokeAPI. Just for fun.

Tasks that needs to be done, finish the fetch for each region (3 total).

Manage to grab the api URL inside each pokemon again, and then be able to display that fetched url onto the page again. Double farFETCH'd! See what I did there :P

Once that is complete, however you wanna display the array of pokemon is kinda up to you, but by going all at once can be boring so try think of a way to display them in a fun and interactive way. Something challenging for yourself.

There are other cools things to add as info from each pokemon, but those come from another api URL again   O.O'
