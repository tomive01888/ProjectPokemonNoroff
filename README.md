/////////////// The work, side project ProjectPokemonNoroff ///////////////

This is a side project, not part of any CA related task given by Noroff. We are Noroff students who decided to work on
our free time and create a webpage using pokeAPI. Just for fun.

Each has their own generation of pokemon they need to display. Our baseline URL does not provide a full array of information
regarding any pokemon, only their name, so a quick loop you can access all the single information you need to get hold of
more content.

Once that is complete, however you wanna display the array of pokemon is kinda up to you, but by going all at once can be
boring so try think of a way to display them in a fun and interactive way. Something challenging for yourself.

//                                                                                               
//                                                                                              
/////////////// Search function ///////////////

Things I want you to try, add a search function using input and have it search by name or id or maybe even type or just a
whole bunch of other search terms to search by. But mainly a search function, doesn't matter which you wanna go by.

//                                                                                              
//                                                                                              
/////////////// A different way of display ///////////////
A "fun" way to display each pokemon on, not a simple array in grid kind of thing. Something like a carousel or something
you can challenge yourself with.

//                                                                                              
//                                                                                              
/////////////// Styling the page is all you, your choice, but be creative, take time and study if needed! ///////////////

Decoration of page is entirely up to you. BUT as a way to show your page, I want you to add something like a signature of
some kind in the footer, something that shows that it is made by you!

//                                                                                              
//

//                                                                                              
/////////////// Extra task ///////////////

As a fun thing to add, I would love it if you manage to add something like a sprite of yourself (you can find something on the
internet, something that relates to you, doesn't have to look just like you). With a name following this
"Trainer .... " or "Bug-catcher .... " "Backpacker ...." something that fits the pokemon theme.
(see more here "https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Category:Trainer_classes" for more options )

6 pokemons of your choice, can be picked from all regions we are using. A display similarly like they have in the games pokebattles type of style.
A display of one pokemon and pokeballs and by clicking it, the pokemon swaps place.

And by clicking on the pokeball you can see the sprite image of pokemon, name, 4 movesets if has, lvl (this can be ranging from 75-100)
and hp bar (does not need to contain any number) Some of these things can be found in the API and some can just be hardcoded.
(Move set can be found in the API and at least the moves it can learn, other wise I can help figure it out with you if you don't know)

You can imagine yourself the elite four champion of that region. I don't expect all to understand this, but you are so to speak the reigning champion!

Where to display this: Either on a different page, linked from your region OR at the very bottom of your page.
As a way to show you and your favorite pokemon :) Along with the signature.

/////////////// Some side info of the file setup: ///////////////

Each generation has their own folder, gen-i, gen-ii and gen-iii. Each again has their own respective folder in assets which you
can add whatever you want to add, images, svg, icons, you name it. You are free to add more folder inside these folders again if
you need to separate anything. Also a shared folder, if you think something that will be or can be used regulary by others here too.
